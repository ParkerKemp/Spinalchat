# Spinalchat
Spinalchat is a small plugin that was created with the idea of providing chat-control features on Spinalcraft that weren't provided from other plugins. As of today, the only feature it boasts is the one that originally necessitated a new plugin: when players are banned from or muted on Spinalcraft, Spinalchat blocks their chat messages on dynmap by linking together the dynmap and Essentials APIs.
